# Reshaping and Joining Data in R with dplyr

The dplyr package is a popular R package that people often use to manipulate and join datasets. You will need to have either some basic knowledge about using R or have previously attended our Introduction to R for Absolute Beginners workshop in order to take this one. Join JHU Data Services for this workshop and you will learn to use several functions, including `mutate()`, `filter()`, `select()`, `summarize()` and `group_by()`, in dplyr to manipulate data for the first half of the workshop. For the second part of this workshop, you will learn the join functions (e.g. `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `inner_join()`, `semi_join()`, `anti_join()`, `full_join()`, `bind_rows()` and `bind_cols()`) and set operations (e.g. `union()`, `intersect()` and `setdiff()`) in dplyr to combine two datasets. You will have plenty of opportunities to do hands-on activities on your laptop and work on datasets provided by instructors.
